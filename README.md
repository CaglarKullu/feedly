# Feedly

#### Feedly is an app I created when I realized there is no app for the sourdough community that has everything inside. 
#### -Flutter Framework 
#### -UX and UI design 
#### -CRUD operations (SQLite) 
#### -State Management (Riverpod) 
#### -Database Model & Design 
#### -Clean code 
#### -During the project, I worked with a product owner to help me manage the project stages. After I completed 
#### -coding, I worked with a designer for branding elements of the app.
